<h1>Copywriting</h1>

<p>It will take time to see results, especially with blogging. See it as an snowball being pushed down a hill, it will be small in the beginning but soon become bigger and bigger. But do get it in the right direction, you have to keep steering it.</p>

<p>Evergreen, keep you post updated over time. Example, if you have written about a software, make sure to update the article when the software is updated.</p>

<p>Who is you nish audience? Try to identify them and try to write for them. Identifying the audience and try to "draw" a picture of that person: What does he/she wants to learn / know?</p>

<ol>
<li>How old is he/she.</li>
<li>Does he/she have a family?</li>
<li>What are his or hers hobbies?</li>
<li>What does he or she work?</li>
<li>What problem can you solve for him or her?</li>
<li>Where does he hangout on-line?</li>
</ol>

<p>What is it exactly that you want he/she to do at the end of your blog post?</p>

<p>A good writer who is educating others will translate an area of expertise into a layman's language.</p>

<p>Try to find stupid questions and answer them in your article/blog. Look in forums etc. for these questions.</p>

<p>Make the blog/article easily to scan through.</p>

<p>By sharing the page on Google+ it will be index to google directly, most important social media for SEO.</p>

<p>Avoid the stock look (photos)! "I hate happy people!".</p>

<h2>AIDA flow copywriting</h2>

<ul>
<li>(A)ttention: Headline (about 3s to get their attention)</li>
<li>(I)nterest: Opening paragraph (about 7s to read)</li>
<li>(D)esire: Main body text</li>
<li>(A)ction: Last paragraph</li>
<li>(P)roof: Review and statistic</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer your self these two questions before starting to write:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is your client trying to buy?
<ol><li>How do they search? Layman's Terms or Technical terms</li>
<li>What keywords do they use, research keywords.</li>
<li>Answer/quote the anticipated search query.</li>
<li>First part of title.</li></ol></li>
<li>What will they gain?
<ol><li>Emotional, Intellectual or Physical gain.</li>
<li>Describe that gain as a benefit.</li></ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Combined these to answers to a title.</p>

<p>Interest is always developed in the opening paragraph. You have about 7s to drive the readers to the desire content. Keep it to 2 or 3 sentences and ask question(s)!</p>

<p>Desire, the main body part. It's educational in nature and should describe how they will benefit.</p>

<p>Action, should be in the last paragraph. The higher the transaction value, the stronger the action statement. Be very clear about the benefits of the CAT(Call To Action).</p>

<p>Proof, backup your claim and promises with statistic and picture or social proof.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Google keyword planner, look for different terms. <a href="http://keywordstool.io">Keywords tool</a></p>

<p>Check the spelling with plugin app as Grammaly and let a thrid party proof read the text.</p>

<h2>How to find a brand:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Show your self to the weird.</li>
<li>Make your self useful.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use these two things to make significant around you, your company and your brand. Where the definition of significant is: the quality of being worth of attention to people how will never buy from you, but always spread the word.</p>

<p>It’s hard to stand out from the crowd, so don’t hang out with the crowed, Instead choose the wired. Where the Wired is a nice, any nice…</p>

<p>Start with the marking campaign before making your product and see if you get any interest about your product.</p>

<p>Make an urgency, what happen if they don't take the action.</p>

<p>A good marking technique is to use “pig” story. Describe a store about a problem you have and how your product help you (hopefully it will help your client as well).</p>

<p>Make strong promises, however, most people markets weak promises. Go to far and then pull back.</p>

<ol>
<li>Forget your product and the reality (for now). What's the promises you would give if you had a magic wand and there where no rules and no limits?</li>
<li>After you get the first point on paper, pull it back to something you actaully can back up and fullfill that won't get you arrested or go to marketing hell.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good promises are detailed and specific.</p>

<p>Machanism makes the promise seems simpler, easier and more "done for you".</p>
